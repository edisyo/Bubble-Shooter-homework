# Bubble Shooter
 Bubble shooter 2D game for homework in Unity

This project was developed as a technical assignment for **_MunchMunchDev_**. 
The goal of the project was to create a simple hyper-casual mobile 
game prototype with a Bubble Shooter mechanic in around 4 hours.
Included subtasks were:
- Gameplay mechanics from the reference game
- An input method for devices without a cursor (e.g. mobile devices)
- Level editor (meaning, levels wouldnâ€™t be random anymore)
- A level selection menu
- Juice (game feel)
- Come up with your own subtask


## The project's main gameplay mechanics are:
- Bubble layout
- Shooting the Bubble
- Attaching shot Bubble to other Bubbles
- Matching Bubbles


## Technology used
- The project is made in the Unity platform using Unity 2021.3.25 LTS
- All scripts are written in C#.
- Project uses URP Render Pipeline.


## How to play instructions
For now, there is only 1 level made and there is only 1 input - mouse button.

**Input:**
- Aim - Using mouse/ cursor
- Shoot Bubble - Left Mouse Button

**Instructions:**
- Open the project in the specified Unity Version
- Press Play
- Use your mouse to aim
- Use Left Mouse Button to Shoot Bubbles


## Challenges
1. Bubble colors
	- _**TLDR:**_ HEX code didnt work. Tried RGB(0-255), but that didn't work. Tried the
	built-in Color.Blue and suddenly worked. Changed all my colors to
	RGB(0-1) and works as intended.
  	- The first big challenge, that I spent way too much time on, is about
	Balloon colors. At first, I wanted to use HEX values for color, Unity
	didn't really seem to support that, which is VERY, VERY weird to me.
	Then I tried to do it with RGB(0-255) values - using Unity's class
	Color, which seemed very intuitive at first. It worked only for a few
	colors, but the color was still a little bit off. Then I spent way too
	much time trying to understand what was happening and playing around with
	different variables. Then I tried to apply simple, built-in colors, like 
	Color.Blue etc. And it worked. Then I was very confused. I debugged the
	new color and it printed out in RGB(0-1). Then I changed all my colors
	to RGB(0-1) and suddenly they worked.

2. Bubble matching
	- I couldn't find a way how to get the bubbles, that are around the 
	just shot bubble. I was thinking about using Raycasts, but thought it
	would be harder and ineffective. I was reading about CircleCollider2D 
	and its methods, then I saw OverlapCollider which led me to find a
	Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll which sounded exactly what I needed. Tried
	it out and it was just what I wanted. I also thought about using arrays,
	but thought that I will have to redo the layout logic.


## Bugs/ Problems
- There is a bug, that rarely after bouncing off the wall, the bubble won't
	attach correctly where it is supposed to attach.


## Future Improvements
- [ ] Need to improve "Floating bubble" logic, does not work correctly
- [ ] Create a full game loop
- [ ] While writing this Readme file and looking at the code, I don't understand
  how I didn't think about this sooner. When creating the layout, I can put each
  Bubble into a 2D array
- [ ] Add a better background image
- [ ] Add UI elements, like score
- [ ] Add Particle Systems and Audio/Sounds
- [ ] Add Main menu and Level selection screen
- [ ] Level editor would be perfect - available colors, layout size and pattern
- [ ] After x missed shots, the whole layout goes down by 1 row
- [ ] Add obstacles
- [ ] Fix Bugs :lady_beetle:



Hope I mentioned everything.
Looking forward to perfecting this project and my skills.
